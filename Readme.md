# SmartSavingsAccount Smart Contract

## Vision

The **SmartSavingsAccount** smart contract provides a decentralized savings mechanism where users can deposit tokens and lock them for a specified period. This contract ensures that funds remain secure during the lock period, promoting disciplined savings and financial management.

## Features

- **Deposit Funds**:
  - Users can deposit tokens into a savings account and set a lock period, ensuring that the funds remain untouched until the period expires.
- **Withdraw Funds**:
  - Users can withdraw their savings once the lock period has expired, with tokens automatically transferred back to their account.

## Future Scope

1. **Interest Accrual**:

   - Implement interest on locked funds to incentivize long-term savings.

2. **Multi-Token Support**:

   - Enable support for multiple tokens, allowing users to deposit different cryptocurrencies.

3. **Partial Withdrawals**:
   - Introduce the ability to withdraw a portion of funds while keeping the remaining balance locked.

The **SmartSavingsAccount** contract encourages long-term savings by securing funds for a specified duration, promoting better financial management through blockchain technology.
